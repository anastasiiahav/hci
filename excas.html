      Robotanica deals with the arrival of robotics in nature and exposes, questions and investigates projects that affect our surroundings. Robotanica ends in June 2018 with an outdoor exhibition in the Tolhuistuin park in Amsterdam with a subsequent program consisting of talks and performances in EYE Film museum. The outdoor exhibition shows a unique setting of living creatures and artistic projects.

      Second Livestock is social experiment about chickens living in a VR world, just like Second Life (a virtual reality world for humans). This is a VR platform for factory chickens who may not be free range, but at can least have a virtual free range experience.<br><br>
      This project developed by Austin Stewart. Austin Stewart is an American professor and scientist. He is developing designs to instigate debates on pressing contemporary issues. Austin received his B.F.A. from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and his M.F.A. from the Ohio State University. All of this works has been introduced around the world.<br>

      Second Livestock is VR free-range farm world what is a safe haven for chickens. In Livestock world they live a life in the open. Chickens at the VR farm are free to whatever they want, like socialize with each other and eat real ‘virtual’ food (it appears in their real food trays). 
      VR installation consist of a mini Oculus Rift headset and earphones which are placed over the eyes and ears of the chicken. This set is giving them possibility to live a beautiful free life, not like in the real life, where chickens are locked in small cages and slow waiting for their death.<br><br>
      The sensors which are attached to the chickens allow them not just to move around the virtual world, but also to send alert to farmers if something is wrong. This way farmers are able to help chickens, and this prevent multiple losses. Second Livestock makes husbandry more humane and profitable.<br><br>
      This installation doesn’t involve real chickens, rather people who are ready to volunteer to experience the VR farm with help of camera, as the eyes of the chicken, earphones to hear the sounds, and a treadmill to navigate through the farm. This set is forcing you to experience the world as if you are a chicken.<br><br>
      Another world where all of the chickens are happy could be experienced through the prototype called Chicken Computer Interface (CCI).<br>
      I think this project is interesting because it combines nature and technologies, such as VR. With help of new technologies, we can improve not just human lifes, but animals as well. This installation helps chickens to eliminate the stress of real life and let them experience a happy beautiful life and this is what I find amazing.
