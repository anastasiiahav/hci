    <h1>Lab Weeks Process</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The last two study weeks we went the Dutch Innovation Factory to work on our assignemnt. Everyone could choose the topic he the most interested in. My topic was Artificial Creatures. Here below you can see the process of building the creature.

    <p>
      Our first day we have started with brainstorming. For hours we have been thinking what for creature are we going to build, and which emotions do we want to trigger.  After we have chosen to create something to fear people, I’ve came up with an idea of creating a spider. <br/>
      After that we as a group have made a list of things what we need to purchase to make our spider.<br/>
      The next step was a research on spiders and sensors, what for sensors could be useful. Till the end of the day I was busy with research and brainstorming.

      Sadly, this day I could not be at Dutch Innovation Factory because of the Arriva strike. So, I was working from home. I’ve continued my research on spiders and sensors. Furthermore, I was looking for existing examples for inspiration.<br/>
      The group went further with research and brainstorming. They also have started to build the prototype.

    <h2>Wednesday, 6 June</h2>

    <p>
      Wednesday was productive. I’ve made 3 prototypes of different boxes-houses for the spider, as well a mini-spider we have called Henk. All of these boxes have different sizes and openings. Together we have tested all of the prototypes and chosen for the prototype 3.<br/>
      I also have brainstormed about the movement of the spider. How he is going to move and turn and what we going to need for it.<br/>
      The rest of the group continued to build the real spider.

    <h2>Thursday, 7 June</h2>

    <p>
      On Thursday I started to make a hi-fi prototype to test it. I’ve been to the Hobby shop to buy some things to create and decorate the spider. I have painted our spiders (one for hi-fi prototype and second for the ‘real’ spider). After that I have brainstormed about the eyes, jaws and legs. How are we going to make it and what are we going to need for it?<br/>
      As a group we have received our first package – robot kit. This kit is going to be a base for the spider. We have connected the base and started to work on the movement.

    <h2>Friday, 8 June</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On Friday I went again to the Hobby shop to buy some things to create the legs. The legs what we bought were too thin for our spider, so I have coated them with some black ropes and tried to attach it to the body.<br/>
      As a group we have continued to experiment with the movement of the spider. We decided to not use the light sensor, so that spider follows light. We agreed that this is unnecessary and we have just 2 weeks to build it, so we have to focus on more important things.

    <h2>Monday, 11 June</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On Monday I was searching for inspiration how to create spider ‘hair’. I’ve been searching for some fake fur online, but in the end, I’ve came up with idea to use cotton pads instead. I’ve painted lots of cotton pads with black spray paint and after that glued it to the carcass with some glue and paint.<br/>
      As a group we made a huge progress. Our spider can move his head and recognize obstacles. Also, the movement has been improved crucially.

    <h2>Tuesday, 12 June</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      My Tuesday I’ve started with brainstorming about the spider sound. Are we going to let him sing some song or make random sounds? For hours and hours, I’ve been searching for some proper sounds and the code what we could use. Sadly, I couldn’t test things what I have found, because I forgot my Arduino kit. <br/>
      After that I’ve been helping to improve our prototype. As a group we finally finished our prototype and tested it.

    <h2>Wednesday, 13 June</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On Wednesday I started to test all codes and theories I’ve found on Tuesday. The speaker what we have ordered wasn’t working the way we expected it to work. It was too quiet. So, we had to come up with new ideas. I have tested couple of different sounds and tried to combine them to get ‘spider’ sound.<br/>
      As a group we have made the decision to not use lights for the eyes, because we had not enough spots left on our Arduino Shield.

      On Thursday we began to solder all pieces together. We started from making a scheme so that the soldering process would be less complicated. One by one we have tried to solder the spider.<br/>
      Our group decided to combine the robot plant from another group in one field. We decided to present it together in ‘Interactive Zoo’, because our robots are functioning pretty much alike. <br/>
      I went to the Hobby shop to buy some glue and accessories to decorate our ‘zoo’. I bought some spider web and baby spiders. We also went to the forest nearby to get some trees to make it look more like a ‘zoo’.

    <p>
      On the Expo day we still had to solder our spider. We decided to not use any sound because of the lack of time. After soldering all pieces together, we tested it again. We put the carcass on and glued it together. I’ve made some scary teeth and attached it to the head. <br/>
      Sadly, the plants what we have took yesterday died, so we had to go again to the forest so get some new plants.<br/>
      At the day of Expo everything always goes wrong. Our robot stopped working at the time the Expo did began. I had to get new batteries to bring our spider back to life. After that we had some issues, but we could fix it and till the end of the Expo our creation was functioning pretty well.
