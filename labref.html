      Frankly speaking, I'm quiet satisfied with the product. Maybe it didn't turn out how we expect it to, but it worked well. I'm proud of our spider. Together with the group we have learned a lot of new things, like working with Arduino and soldering. Our spider has no legs, or jaws, or any sound as we planned it to have in the very beginning, but it still can do pretty cool things as move around and recognise objects. Sure if we had more than two weeks to build it, it would have all missing elements and some extra.<br><br>
      Most of the time I was busy with design. I have designed the prototype of spider, the prototype of the present box (what we have decided to not use) and the place where we presented our creature. Comparing to my group, I have made less programming than I expected. I still tried to make the eyes and the sound with Arduino (what we ended up to not use as well). I know that I could do more programming as well, but 5 people working on same laptop with same creature is a bit too much and not handy.<br><br>
      From the very beggining I was always motivated. When the course started I already knew that I will choose the Artificial Creatures. This topic always excited me. I couldn't wait till the beginning of the lab weeks. During the lab weeks I never lost my motivation, even when things didn't turned out the way we wanted it to be.<br>
      Honestly I didn't expect that we, without much knowlegde of Arduino, will be able to build a creature in two weeks. I not have just learned a lot of new things, but also had great time during these two weeks and met a lot of different interesting people.
